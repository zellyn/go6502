/*
Package visual provides routines for emulating a 6502 at the
transistor level, using data from visual6502.org.

It started out as an almost token-for-token translation of
https://github.com/mist64/perfect6502, and is slowly changing to be a
little more go-like, although keeping it fast seems to mean keeping
the c-nature.
